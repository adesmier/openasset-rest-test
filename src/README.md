## SRC Directory
Here we'll define all of our JavaScript files. If we were to add additional source files in another language we could add sub-folders to seperate these from the JS files.

#### `index.js`
This is our app entry point that contains our `ReactDOM.render()` call to output everything to our HTML boilerplate - _index.html_

Webpack also uses this file as it's entry point to create the _bundle.js_ file of all the React related JS code.

### `components` Directory

### `plugins` Directory

### `redux` Directory

### `scripts` Directory
